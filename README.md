## Interactive Music Theory and Audio Synthesis

The Circle of Fifths is a responsive web application that serves as both a music theory reference and an interactive synthesizer. It utilizes the Web Audio API to generate organic, polyphonic tones in real-time while providing dynamic visual feedback through a central canvas-based visualizer.

## Project Intent

The primary goal of this project was to move beyond static diagrams by creating a tactile, audible experience for exploring harmonic relationships. By integrating SVG geometry with a custom audio engine, the application allows users to hear the character of major and minor triads while seeing how patterns repeat across the chromatic scale.

## Core Features

* **Interactive SVG Interface:** A custom-rendered dual-ring layout representing Major (outer) and Minor (inner) keys.
* **Real-time Audio Synthesis:** Sound is generated on-the-fly using oscillators rather than samples, allowing for a lightweight and responsive experience.
* **Dynamic Visualizer:** A central Canvas visualizer that maps the waveform and RMS energy of the active chord to a "breathing" circular display.
* **Contextual Feedback:** An info panel that displays the specific notes comprising each triad as they are played.

## Technical Implementation

### Audio Architecture

The audio engine is designed to emulate the characteristics of analog hardware:

* **Oscillator Mixing:** Each note in a triad is generated by blending a triangle wave for fundamental body and a sawtooth wave for harmonic clarity.
* **Signal Chain:** The signal passes through a BiquadFilter (lowpass) with a custom "bloom" envelope and a WaveShaper node for soft-clipping saturation.
* **Organic Drift:** To prevent a sterile digital sound, each voice includes a randomized LFO that modulates detuning, simulating the subtle pitch instability of analog circuitry.
* **Polyphony Management:** A custom cleanup routine handles rapid user interaction, ensuring smooth gain ramps and preventing audio clipping or artifacts when switching between chords.

### Visualization Engine

The visualizer uses an AnalyserNode to extract real-time frequency and time-domain data:

* **Waveform Mapping:** Time-domain data is transformed into polar coordinates and rendered on a Canvas.
* **Energy Reactivity:** The radius and "glow" of the visualizer are modulated by the Root Mean Square (RMS) energy of the audio, causing the center of the circle to pulse in sync with the sound.

## Design and UX Philosophy

The interface emphasizes clarity and reduced friction for the end user:

* **Spatial Mapping:** The layout follows the traditional music theory circle, placing relative minors directly inside their major counterparts to reinforce the relationship between keys.
* **Color Logic:** The UI uses a system of CSS variables to distinguish between natural and accidental keys. When a triad is played, the individual segments for the 1st, 3rd, and 5th steps are highlighted in distinct shades to visualize the chord structure.
* **Accessibility:** High-contrast text with legibility halos ensures readability against various segment colors, and the interface is fully responsive across different screen dimensions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge recommended).
3. Click any segment on the circle to initialize the audio context and begin exploring.
